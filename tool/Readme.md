# Tool Usage #

## matlab code ##

   input: 32-point signal x in line-5, which is based on t from 0 to 31

   output: 32-point fft result of x

   After running this matlab code, we obtain two txt file: 

   (1) input_k.txt (2) output_k.txt

   (k is to be altered in .m code)

   In these two files, the data are stored as doubles.

## python code ##

   input: txt files from matlab
